Bill Splitting chatbot

Splitting the cost of bills and expenses can be a clumsy process. You have to calculate who owed what, then go through the tedious task of collecting money from each person.



Build a chatbot app that does the following.

1. Let you divide up the cost of things like group dinners, group trips

2. Inform each of your friend how much he/she owes
